# TICES
*terminus inter conscios et sensus* — the boundary between the conscious and the senses

A theory for sensory processing by the conscious, drawing from psychedelic observations and computer vision analogies. Statistical analysis of ResNet50 weights (prior vs post training) provides parallel support, `Code` hyperlink in [TICES.pdf](https://github.com/dylanmmarshall/TICES/blob/main/TICES.pdf) is null, refer instead to [code.ipynb](https://github.com/dylanmmarshall/TICES/blob/main/code.ipynb), the results are approximately the same. See the comments in the notebook for more detail.

## Setup
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# run code.ipynb
```

Ongoing: electrical circuit analogies and analysis that might help further explain this theory
